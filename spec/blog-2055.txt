Galaxy Notes
18 July 2020, 14:30 EEST, by Igor Lukanin

We're so much thrilled to watch the teams progressing through the lightning
round (which ends on July 18 at 13:00 UTC) and posting beautiful images of their
galaxies in Discord. It took some time and effort to create our own “galaxy
evaluator” and render our own images properly.

First, we decided to overlay all images with different opacities.

Second, we found a way to enter two-dimensional vectors into the evaluator. We
use mouse clicks for that as every click produces a convenient (x,y) pair.

Third, we've got our hands on the galaxy. So beautiful!

Fourth, we continued to explore. We immediately saw that our evaluator sent
something to our own proxy! And we've got very complicated images as a result.
As of this moment, we have no idea about their meaning.

We hope that our galaxy notes will help you to render your own images!

P.S. We're glad to see that participants continue to contribute more detailed
interpretations of the messages. In particular, we like the message #38.
