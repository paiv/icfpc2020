A Huge Message is Coming, and Text is Better Than Images

We're really amused by the great progress you're making with decoding the
messages.

We're monitoring the chat in Discord for your suggestions on the meaning of
messages and names for unknown symbols appearing in these messages. We're
updating the documentation accordingly. Keep going!

At the same time, we have more news from Pegovka Observatory! Our friend Ivan
Zaitsev says that a new message which appears to be REALLY HUGE is being
received right now. We don't really know if we'll be able to render this message
as an image. In this case, we'll post this message as text. That is why it is
very important that you give names to unknown symbols in the messages.

We'll make a new post when this REALLY HUGE message is ready.
