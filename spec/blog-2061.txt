We sincerely thank all the participants of the ICFP Contest 2020. That was our
honor and great pleasure to organize this contest for you.

We hope that you had fun too.

In the next 7 days, we kindly ask you to do the following:

Make public your repository (specified in the team profile). Don't forget to
commit there your “galaxy evaluator” (or “Galaxy Pad”), if any. Add a README,
share your experience, pictures, videos, and write-ups. Definitely do so, if you
wish your team to be considered for a prize.

Optionally, leave feedback (the link will appear right here.)

Warm regards,

Alexander Khramtsov, Alexey Kirpichnikov, Andrey Kostousov, Igor Lukanin, Ivan
Dashkevich, Nika Samokhina, Nikita Sivukhin, Pavel Egorov
