Dear participants of the ICFP Contest 2020. We have prepared a great contest for
you! But we have strong reasons to throw it out and ask you to put your efforts
into something else.

Our friend Ivan Zaitsev, a staff astronomer at Pegovka Observatory, has recently
become a part of a very peculiar story. During the last two weeks he has
received many messages from an unidentified source which was later recognized as
a spacecraft. Ivan has made some progress in decoding and understanding the
messages but recently the spacecraft has transmitted a lot more.

Please help to decode the messages! The humankind needs your help.

Ivan will be right here with the ICFP Contest organizers. Reach out to him on Discord.
