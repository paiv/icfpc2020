HOW TO ACTUALLY WIN THE CONTEST
18 July 2020, 16:45 EEST, by Igor Lukanin

Hi. We have news!

After a little bit of tinkering with our own “galaxy evaluator” we've come to
understanding about the true meaning of images we get by running any
“evaluator”.

We were able to understand what the “aliens” want to express.

Since we have to combine this “alien story” with the ICFP Contest, we've decided
to recognize the winners of the “local tournament” as the winners of the ICFP
Contest. The exact scoring rules will be published soon.

We encourage you to study the “alien story”, bravely fight the “battles”, and
gloriously win the “local tournament”. Good luck!
