Everyone Has a Say

When Ivan Zaitsev read the suggestion to transmit something to the spacecraft
again in regard to the message #36 in Discord, he was energized. We modulated a
list of a single zero element for Ivan, and he transmitted that message with his
antenna at Pegovka Observatory.

Andâ€¦ he got the response! This one: 110110000111011111100001001111110101000000.

When Ivan repeated the transmission after approximately 10 seconds, he received
another response: 110110000111011111100001001111110100110000.

Neither Ivan, nor we have any idea about the meaning of these responses. That's
why now we're going to create a proxy so any team is able to transmit something
and get something in return.

Can't wait to share this proxy with you!
