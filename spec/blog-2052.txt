SCORE POINTS & WIN CONTEST
17 July 2020, 20:30 EEST, by Igor Lukanin

Okay, we're ready to publish the REALLY HUGE message. We've decided not to
render it as an image and just publish it as text. Really, who has a monitor
this large?

We've also enabled the scoreboard. To score points and win the lightning round
(which ends on July 18 at 13:00 UTC), we ask you to make progress with
understanding that REALLY HUGE message. Feel free to collaborate in Discord or
play secretly.

Note that you can get 1 point right now for using the proxy. Also, for
historical reasons, you can still get 1 point for making a successful
submission.
